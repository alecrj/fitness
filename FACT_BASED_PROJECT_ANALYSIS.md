## CRITICAL UNKNOWNS
1. Main application file (app.py) - not provided
2. Configuration file (config.py) - not provided
3. Utils directory structure - not provided
4. Frontend implementation - not provided yet
5. Requirements.txt - dependencies unclear

## NEXT FILES NEEDED FOR COMPLETE ANALYSIS
1. `app.py` - Main application entry point
2. `config.py` - Configuration management
3. `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
4. `utils/` directory contents
5. Frontend files (if they exist)

## FACTS ONLY - NO ASSUMPTIONS
- Backend has complete REST APIs for all 4 modules
- Firebase is the chosen database/auth solution
- Python/Flask is the backend framework
- All service files are empty (placeholder)
- Recipe models are empty despite working routes
- Documentation exists but may be outdated
- No frontend implementation has been shared yet

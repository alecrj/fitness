# Fitness/Food App Test Plan

## Test Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Focus on core business logic
- Use mocks for external dependencies (Firebase, USDA API)
- Target: 80%+ code coverage

### Integration Testing
- Test interaction between modules
- Verify correct data flow between components
- Test Firebase integration with emulators
- Validate critical user workflows

### API Testing
- Test all API endpoints for correct behavior
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test input validation and error handling
- Verify rate limiting functionality

### Security Testing
- Validate authentication mechanisms
- Test authorization for protected resources
- Check for common security vulnerabilities
- Validate data validation and sanitization

## Test Modules and Priorities

### High Priority (P0)
- Authentication flows
- Recipe creation and retrieval
- Nutrition tracking core features
- Data persistence

### Medium Priority (P1)
- Social features
- Search functionality
- Recipe import
- Background tasks

### Lower Priority (P2)
- Performance monitoring
- Admin functions
- Reporting features

## Test Environments
- Local development environment
- Test environment with Firebase emulators
- Staging environment with isolated Firebase project
- Production-like environment

## Testing Tools
- `unittest` for unit testing
- `pytest` for more advanced testing
- Firebase emulators for integration testing
- Postman/curl for API testing

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Tests
- Models: Nutrition, Recipe, Social models
- Services: Firebase integration, USDA API client
- Utilities: Validators, helpers, background tasks

### Phase 2: API Tests
- Auth endpoints
- Recipe endpoints
- Nutrition endpoints
- Social endpoints

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
- End-to-end workflows
- Cross-module interactions

### Phase 4: Performance & Load Tests
- API response times
- Concurrent user simulation
- Database query performance

## Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every pull request
- Block merges if tests fail
- Generate coverage reports

## Acceptance Criteria
- All P0 tests must pass for release
- No security vulnerabilities in authentication or data access
- API response times under 200ms for critical operations
- 80%+ code coverage for core business logic

4. **Background Processing**: Asynchronous task handling for long-running operations.
5. **Data Model**: Firestore NoSQL data model optimized for read performance.
6. **API Protection**: Rate limiting and robust error handling for production stability.
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests with mocked dependencies.
8. **OpenAPI Documentation**: Self-documenting API with Swagger UI.
9. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing with GitHub Actions.

## Environment & Dependencies

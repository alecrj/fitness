## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Blueprint Architecture**: Modular code organization using Flask blueprints for different features.
2. **Firebase Integration**: Using Firebase for authentication, database, and storage.
3. **Stateless API Design**: RESTful API design with stateless authentication.
4. **Background Processing**: Asynchronous task handling for long-running operations.
5. **Data Model**: Firestore NoSQL data model optimized for read performance.
6. **API Protection**: Rate limiting and robust error handling for production stability.

## Environment & Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Flask 3.1.0
- Firebase Admin SDK 6.8.0
- USDA API Integration
- See requirements.txt for complete list

## Development Workflow
1. Feature planning and design
2. Implementation with TDD approach
3. Code review and quality checks
4. Documentation update
5. Integration testing
6. Deployment

## Notes & Action Items
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
- Evaluate GraphQL as an alternative for some API endpoints
- Need to finalize data retention policy
- Review security for firebase rules
